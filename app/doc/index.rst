A web interface to control the ChronoRoot robot module.

Module description
------------------

A ChronoRoot module aim to take regular picture of in-vitro plates of growing
plants. The plate are "classical" scare transparent plates (125mmx125mm) that
are put vertically in a support. In front of each plate a camera is present that
is control by the module (a Raspberry Pi).

To be able to follow the root growth in all condition a IR back light is
positioned behind the plates. It allow to take pictures even during the night
without disturbing the plants and to get read of the reflection on the plates due
to the light of the growth chamber. The back light is optional and could be
actionable at the experiment level.

Each module is able to control 4 cameras
